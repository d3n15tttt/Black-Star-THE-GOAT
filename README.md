## 📖 What's This?

Yo, I built this site as a fun learning project to dive into coding while celebrating all the awesome characters from Soul Eater!

## 🎯 What’s the Deal?

- **Simple HTML & CSS**: Keeping it real with clean code.
- **Tribute Vibes**: A shout-out to Black☆Star because why not?

## 🚨 Just So You Know

> **Heads Up!**
> - This is a personal fan project—nothing too serious.
> - All rights to Soul Eater and its characters belong to Atsushi Ōkubo.
> - Not for profit; just a fun coding experiment.
> - Totally educational. I'm just trying to figure out this web thing.
> - This project was whipped up as part of the [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) in the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I did stray a bit from the script, so it's not exactly what the course outlined.
